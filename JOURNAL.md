## 10/17/2025 - Setup the project  

Setup the project. The symbols and footprints were obtained from Raspberry Pi's official KiCad design files for the CM5 I/O board. The board will be split into several sheets - the root sheet, with the Type-C circuit and a few other things, the CM5 GPIO sheet, which handles CM5's GPIO breakouts, and the CM5 high speed sheet, which handles HDMI, USB, PCIe, and a few other things.
