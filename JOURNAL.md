This is my journal of the design and building process of **CM5_NAS**.

## 10/17/2025 - Setup the project  

Setup the project. The symbols and footprints were obtained from Raspberry Pi's official KiCad design files for the CM5 I/O board. The board will be split into several sheets - the root sheet, with the Type-C circuit and a few other things, the CM5 GPIO sheet, which handles CM5's GPIO breakouts, and the CM5 high speed sheet, which handles HDMI, USB, PCIe, and a few other things.

## 10/18/2025 - Finished most of the schematic  

Fixed a few mistakes in the initial schematic.

Finished the high speed sheet that handles the high-speed interfaces of the CM5, being USB3, HDMI, and the display/camera connectors.

Finished the GPIO sheet that handles Ethernet, SD, and a few other things.

Finished the M.2 sheet that has the M.2 PCIe connector.

Switched many things from global to net labels as it is much easier to keep track of.

The next step is to use the currently unused USB3-1 to do SATA connections.

Parts of the schematic were used from the official Raspberry Pi CM5 IO Board schematics, and adapted to my use case.
